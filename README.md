# Final Project Template

KIEI-451 Winter 2021

Application Overview: 
An app that allows golfers to notify beverage cart attendants that they'd like a beverage or a snack by signaling what course/hole they are at and then be placed in a queue system. This would help the cart attendants better plan their routes around the golf course to maximize sales. Requests are then sorted by the "created" timestamp. Golfer requests can then be deleted from queue once fulfilled (in MVP, any user can do this. Although in real-life users would only be able to see their requests and the cart attendants would have a public view and the ability to fulfill/delete requests)
