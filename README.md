# Final Project Template

KIEI-451 Winter 2021

Application Overview: 
An app that allows golfers to notify beverage cart attendants that they'd like a beverage or a snack by signaling what course/hole they are at and then be placed in a queue system. This would help the cart attendants better plan their routes around the golf course to maximize sales. Requests are then sorted by the "created" timestamp. Golfer requests can then be deleted from queue once fulfilled.
