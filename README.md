# Final Project Template

KIEI-451 Winter 2021

Application Overview: 
An app that allows golfers to notify beverage cart attendants that they'd like a beverage or a snack by signaling what hole they are at and then be placed in a queue system. This would help the cart attendants better plan their routes around the golf course to maximize sales. There could also be a feature that allows certain users to jump ahead in the queue by flagging to promise a tip.
